# Purpose
This repo is a collection of pages that were created to run content on the data studio monitors

## Pages
* [DLX static projector page](dlx_static_projector/index.html)
* [DLX static tableau presentation page](eventstatic/index.html)
* [DLX NSF vizzies videos](CATalystDLXeventvideo/index.html)
* [Creative Coding Playlist](CATalystPlaylistdev/index.html)

## Customizations
Several of these pages depend on google spreadsheets that hold the links they iterate over. This means that further modification can be performed without changing the application code by adding more content to these google sheets according to the existing patterns in place

    * note that the vizzies links correspond to the videos that will play with the NSF vizzies video page
    * the creative coding playlist pulls from all the other ones
