# Purpose
This repo is a collection of content created for the data studio monitors

## Google Slide Shows
In general you can follow this size template to create slides that can be stretched across the two displays of the vis PC.
*  [3 column per screen Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NHlzmIyBmmLJK9dn-9Y4OIvbymMPe-C6dZo4himj18o/edit?usp=sharing)

**Examples**
* [ABOR visit 2025](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12AG1TLL0Q-2X_POTQM4h9SAoyjCi43y09m4Q8hjqxxw/present) 

*Special note*, the firefox browser on the vis PC has been configured with a custom addon that will automatically make any embedded videos auto loop, so please make use of this browser instead of chrome for these kinds of presentations

## Web Pages
* [DLX static projector page](dlx_static_projector/index.html)
* [DLX static tableau presentation page](eventstatic/index.html)
* [DLX NSF vizzies videos](CATalystDLXeventvideo/index.html)
* [Creative Coding Playlist](CATalystPlaylistdev/index.html)
* [Creative Coding workshops](creative_coding/index.html)

## Customizations
Several of these pages depend on google spreadsheets that hold the links they iterate over. This means that further modification can be performed without changing the application code by adding more content to these google sheets according to the existing patterns in place

    * note that the vizzies links correspond to the videos that will play with the NSF vizzies video page
    * the creative coding playlist pulls from all the other ones
